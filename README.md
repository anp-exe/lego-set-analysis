## Examining the history of Lego sets.

The Rebrickable dataset includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, etc.

The LEGO Parts/Sets/Colors and Inventories of every official LEGO set in the Rebrickable database is available for download as csv files here. These files are automatically updated daily. If you need more details, you can use the API which provides real-time data, but has rate limits that prevent bulk downloading of data.

## 🌟How to view my analysis:

All my code for this can be found in this notebook: [Lego analysis](LEGO_Data_Analysis.ipynb).
